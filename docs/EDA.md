Spotify API provides Audio Features Objects for each track, including "danceability", "energy", "key", "loudness", "mode", "speechiness", "acousticness", "instrumentalness", "liveness", "valence", and â€œtempo." We believe that these quantitative features can be used to compare songs and help us make recommendations. We looked at some histograms to see the distributions of these predictors; tempo seemed a little right-skewed and danceability seemed a little left-skewed, but most appeared to be normally distributed among our sample of tracks analyzed.
